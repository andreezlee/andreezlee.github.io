				<p>Past Projects</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>Masters Project</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Master of Engineering project was implementing and aiding in additional research under a PhD candidate in the Communication and Collaborative Technologies Lab under <a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/susan-fussell" target="_blank">Susan Fussell</a> . Project was a collaborative effort with other M.Eng candidates, designing NLP features to implement <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness_files/politeness.pdf" target="_blank">published research on discovering signals of formality/politeness in the English language</a>. In addition, my portion included using neural/probabilistic machine learning models to analyze new datasets on university students of both native English and non-native English speaking backgrounds, using their perceptions of politeness in textual English data.

			<h3>
				<p>Runtime Verification</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Under the guidance of a PhD course on runtime verification, designed a <a href="https://github.com/andreezlee/OS-Runtime-Verification" target="_blank">final project</a> for analyzing C memory allocation in Linux kernels. The project involved designing specifications inspired by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225450900_Runtime_Verification_of_C_Memory_Safety" target="_blank">published research on C memory safety</a> and attempted to provide a language-agnostic approach for runtime verification. The implementation focused on SystemTap and was tested on the DaCapo suite of Java projects.

			<h3>
				<p>Web App Development</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				As part of a group project in Spring 2020, I was a main contributor to both front-end and back-end development of a web app <a href="http://subreddit-recommender.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Subreddit Recommender</a>. Built in Flask and deployed in Heroku, it uses a specialized dataset of Reddit posts to recommend subreddit communities given a user's post. Techniques employed include cosine similarity measures, sentiment analysis and pseudo-relevance feedback.

			<h3>
				<p>Computational Linguistics</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>My first project in computational linguistics was in Spring 2018. Using the Foma FST for parsing grammar via a state machine and Java to store strings from the <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T10" target="_blank">French Gigaword Third Edition</a> linguistic corpus, I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/andreezlee/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master/Fren-Engl%20Machine%20Translation" target="_blank">French-English Machine Translation</a> engine for French statements and questions taken from the corpus.</p>
				<p>During Fall 2019, I took leadership roles in group projects for Natural Language Processing. Implementations of projects included PyTorch representations of neural networks and other ML methods, exploring Naive Bayes, n-gram models, feed-forward neural networks, and recurrent neural networks for tasks such as spam filtering, parts-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. Final project included integrating and replicating some of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf?source=post_elevate_sequence_page---------------------------" target="_blank">latest research</a> in pretrained models.The project used both state-of-the-art BERT models and more traditional approximations for common-sense reasoning tasks, using data from the Cloze test corpus <a href="https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/" target="_blank">ROCStories</a>.</p>
				<p>In Spring 2020, for the purpose of language typology and exploring new methods in <a href="http://www.comparativelinguistics.uzh.ch/bickel-files/papers/bickel_nichols_bls32.pdf" target="_blank">Predictive Areality Theory</a>, I implemented feed-forward neural networks in PyTorch to predict new linguistic areas. These networks were trained with data from the <a href="https://wals.info/" target="_blank">World Atlas of Language Structures</a>. <a href="https://github.com/andreezlee/ProgrammingProjects/tree/master/Predictive%20Areality%20Theory" target="_blank">These PAT models</a> were an experiment for using existing, publicly-available data for this new area of linguistic research.</p>

			<h3>
				<p>Operating Systems</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>For Systems Programming in Fall 2017, the final project was my own implementation of the &lt;malloc&gt; library. This included implementation of page allocation and memory management, via a linked-list of blocks stored within a 4KB page.</p>
				<p>During Fall 2018, as part of the Practicum in Operating Systems, when given an incomplete Unix-based operating system, I implemented in C several missing data structures for executing basic functionality. This included a simple linked-list queue, a user-level thread control unit, a multi-level feedback queue for process scheduling, a write-through cache with a CLOCK eviction algorithm, and a FAT file system.</p>
