				<p>About Me</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p> Hi, I am Andre Lee, an aspiring engineer located in Central NY. As a recent graduate in Computer Science, I am hoping to train and build my skills to find my place in the industry. While I still consider myself a novice programmer, I believe my prior education and experience have prepared me well.
				</p>

				<p> Most of work experience has been in systems research, while my past projects have touched upon full-stack development and exploring new areas of artificial intelligence. I believe they have built up my problem-solving skills and abilities to work in a collaborative environment. With a wide range of interests within the field, I assure you I am a fast learner and always willing to try new techniques and approaches.</p>

				<p> I also hold a strong belief in community. Since high school, I have dedicated myself to multiple charities, non-profits, and volunteering opportunities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have tried to make a positive impact through opportunities I was given. Within my work, I hope to take pride in developing tools or products useful in improving the lives of others.</p>
