				<p>About Me</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p> Hello! I'm Andre, a junior software engineer located in Western New York. I am part of the Technology Development Program at M&T Bank, gaining exposure to different technology areas in the department. Currently, my work has included scripting and backend development, as well as working with integrations between servers and SaaS applications.
				</p>

				<p> However, my interests lie in systems security and machine learning. Before joining M&T, most of my work experience had been in cybersecurity research, while my past projects touched upon full-stack development and exploring new areas of artificial intelligence. They started me on the path to work in a collaborative environment and constantly develop my skills by trying new techniques and approaches.</p>

				<p> Besides those interests, I also hold a strong belief in community. Volunteering and community engagement have been a passion of mine since I was little, and I continue to bring those commitments to M&T Bank and the WNY community. As I build my career, I hope to take pride in developing tools or products useful in improving the lives of others.</p>
