				<p>Work Experience</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>Graduate Teaching Assistant at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY)</p>
				<p>September to December 2020</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Graduate TA for the Natural Language Processing class.</li>
					<li>Designing and grading projects introducing students to language applications of machine learning.</li>
					<li>Gathering and utilizing student feedback in managing office hours and course logistics.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>This was my first experience as a TA. Beyond grading assignments, the work included designing projects for students; through meeting with faculty and undergrad TA's, these projects allowed me to combine perspectives from the professor and from students of different levels of competency in the subject matter. It allowed me to learn additional skills regarding teaching high-level concepts via online methods.</p>

			<h3>
				<p>Platform Engineering Intern (Remote) at forIndiaToday</p>
				<p>July to October 2020</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Backend engineer for a platform devoted to COVID-19 relief in India.</li>
					<li>Designed a proof of concept for database management system for Indian citizens’ information in job matching.</li>
					<li>Crafting solutions for communication framework usable even in remote villages.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>forIndiaToday is a student initiative partnered with Indian agencies and NGO's to address COVID concerns. This was my first time having coworkers and orgnizational partners on the other side of the world, and I gained valuable experience in adjusting my schedule for the constant communication necessary for multiple aspects of the work. Mainly working on the backend, I had to take into account the circumstances of providing aid to diverse, multilingual, rural users.</p>

			<h3>
				<p>Engineering Intern (Remote) at Generation Do!</p>
				<p>July to August 2020</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implementing front-end features for the website using React framework and Airtable API.</li>
					<li>Led automation of matching framework between organizational partners and database of student applicants.</li>
					<li> Worked with founders and team leaders to streamline team organization and timelines for meeting with clients.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>This internship with Generation Do! was my first experience with student-run initiatives/startups. As all of us were either students or recent grads, it took time for me to adjust to a working environment filled with a lot of uncertainty. The organizational structure was very decentralized and I learned to adjust my work to multiple stakeholders such as other teams who needed specific tools built, partners who had certain expectations of our platform, and the students who signed up for our services via social media.</p>

			<h3>
				<p>Cybersecurity Co-op Intern at Siege Technologies (Rome, NY)</p>
				<p>January to August 2019</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Investigated adaptations of open-source projects into in-house versions for use as research tools.</li>
					<li>Designed applications and modules for hypervisor development.</li>
					<li>Programmed and adapted applications for use with specific Android kernels.</li>
					<li>Developed test cases and crafted coding frameworks for a regression testing suite for team members to use.</li>
					<li>Researched vulnerabilities and exploits; presented research data to PI and other team members.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>Siege Technologies was my first taste of work in the industry. My internship taught me my real first steps as a researcher, developer and trusted colleague in the workplace. The work included multiple contracts for R&D pertaining to monitoring and protecting a variety of Linux-based systems. This included heavy use of Linux and Docker environments, as well as Git for collaborative purposes. I also greatly improved my proficiency in C and Python. In my opinion, the greatest skill I learned was the ability to understand code written by others, and adapt them according to specific research needs.</p>
