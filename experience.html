				<p>Work Experience</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>Cybersecurity Co-op Intern at Siege Technologies (Rome, NY)</p>
				<p>January to August 2019</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Investigated adaptations of open-source projects into in-house versions for use as research tools.</li>
					<li>Designed applications and modules for hypervisor development.</li>
					<li>Programmed and adapted applications for use with specific Android kernels.</li>
					<li>Developed test cases and crafted coding frameworks for a regression testing suite for team members to use.</li>
					<li>Researched vulnerabilities and exploits; presented research data to PI and other team members.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>Siege Technologies was my first taste of work in the industry. My internship taught me my real first steps as a researcher, developer and trusted colleague in the workplace. The work included multiple contracts for R&D pertaining to monitoring and protecting a variety of Linux-based systems. This included heavy use of Linux and Docker environments, as well as Git for collaborative purposes. I also greatly improved my proficiency in C and Python. In my opinion, the greatest skill I learned was the ability to understand code written by others, and adapt them according to specific research needs.</p>
