				<p>Work Experience</p>
			</h2>
			<h3>
				<p>Technology Development Program Engineer (Buffalo, NY)</p>

			</h3>

				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>This was my first employment under a financial institution, of which I was originally a customer. As part of a rotation, this was an opportunity to increase the breadth of my tech skills and exposure within a professional environment. I have gained alot of experience in individual software development tasks alongside SaaS systems and their own limitations. While I have struggled in the very regulated environment, I have learned to operate more efficiently in a workplace with high levels of necessary compliance.</p>

			<h3>

I witnessed first-hand impacts of remote learning and COVID-19 on students in the district (generally from Kindergarten to 6th grade). Coming in one day at a time to be a stranger temporarily replacing a trusted adult in the lives of schoolchildren, was a struggle. I developed additional skills in responding to stressful situations underlying the transitions between online and in-person schooling for the very young. </p>

			<h3>
				<p>Engineering Intern (Remote) at Generation Do!</p>
				<p>July to August 2020</p>
			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implementing front-end features for the website using React framework and Airtable API.</li>
					<li>Led automation of matching framework between organizational partners and database of student applicants.</li>
					<li> Worked with founders and team leaders to streamline team organization and timelines for meeting with clients.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>This internship with Generation Do! was my first experience with student-run initiatives/startups. As all of us were either students or recent grads, it took time for me to adjust to a working environment filled with a lot of uncertainty. The organizational structure was very decentralized and I learned to adjust my work to multiple stakeholders such as other teams who needed specific tools built, partners who had certain expectations of our platform, and the students who signed up for our services via social media.</p>

				<p>Cybersecurity Co-op Intern at Siege Technologies (Rome, NY)</p>

			</h3>
			<h4>
				<p>Main Duties:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Investigated adaptations of open-source projects into in-house versions for use as research tools.</li>

					<li>Developed test cases and crafted coding frameworks for a regression testing suite for team members to use.</li>
					<li>Researched vulnerabilities and exploits; presented research data to PI and other team members.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>What I Learned:</p>
				<p>Siege Technologies was my first taste of work in the industry. My internship taught me my real first steps as a researcher, developer and trusted colleague in the workplace. The work included multiple contracts for R&D pertaining to monitoring and protecting a variety of Linux-based systems. This included heavy use of Linux and Docker environments, as well as Git for collaborative purposes. I also greatly improved my proficiency in C and Python. In my opinion, the greatest skill I learned was the ability to understand code written by others, and adapt them according to specific research needs.</p>
